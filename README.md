# Peptidome_review
The set of tables, scripts and notebooks that have been used to analyse peptidomic datasets for the review paper.

In this review, we summarize our knowledge about generation of different types of peptides, their precursors and biological function. In addition, we analyzed selected peptidome datasets from plants, bacteria, human and yeast to find out some common trends in their composition and physicochemical properties.
