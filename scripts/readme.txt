peptide_generator.py - script generates random peptides from protein precursors. The script takes peptides identified by mass-spectrometry analysis and generates the same number of peptides with the same length as MS-identified peptides, but in random position across precursor length

peptide_mapper.py - script returns peptide coordinates on protein precursors
